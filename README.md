# Redshift-3DS
Redshift is a (future) [Lightquark](https://dev.lightquark.network) client for the Nintendo 3DS. Lightquark is an open instant messaging platform, similar to Discord and Slack.

# Warning
This is basically my first proper coding project, so expect it to suck. I created this repo so I can get more familiar with git, and to have a convinient way to share my code. A proper release may or may not happen
